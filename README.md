# IPGrepper

## Description
The IP Address and Range Grepper is a Bash script that allows for easy extraction of IP addresses or IP ranges with CIDR notation from a given text file.

## Features
- **Extract IP Addresses**: Extracts standard IP addresses from a text file.
- **Extract IP Ranges with CIDR**: Extracts IP ranges in CIDR notation.
- **Flexible File Input**: Accepts the file path as a command-line argument.

## Prerequisites
- Bash environment (Typically available on Unix/Linux systems)
- Text file containing IP addresses or IP ranges

## Usage
1. **Clone or Download the Script**:
Download `ipgrepper.sh` to your local system.

2. **Make the Script Executable** (if necessary):
```bash
   chmod +x ipgrepper.sh
```
3. **Run the Script with the Input File**
```bash
sh ipextractor.sh [path_to_your_file]
```
Replace `[path_to_your_file]` with the path to the file you want to process.

4. **Follow On-screen Instructions:**
Choose whether to extract standard IP addresses (option 1) or IP ranges with CIDR (option 2).

## Output
The script will output the extracted IPs or IP ranges to a file named `output.txt` in the same directory as the script.
